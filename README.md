Title: Identification of nitrogen nutritional status in Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés applying segmentation and analysis image in RGB system.
Wellington Renato Mancin - NUSP:8458603
Abstract: The objective of this project is to indicate through color using RGB system if the forage grass Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés has sufficient or deficient nitrogen status. To do this, it is necessary to obtain an image of the grass in the field under a black background, perform the image segmentation to extract only the diagnostic leaf of the grass and apply other processing so that through the average values in RGB it is possible to indicate if the area of pasture is sufficient or deficient in nitrogen.
