Title: Identification of nitrogen nutritional status in Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés applying segmentation and analysis image in RGB system.
Wellington Renato Mancin - NUSP:8458603
Abstract: The objective of this project is to indicate through color using RGB system if the forage grass Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés has sufficient or deficient nitrogen status. To do this, it is necessary to obtain an image of the grass in the field under a black background, perform the image segmentation to extract only the diagnostic leaf of the grass and apply other processing so that through the average values in RGB it is possible to indicate if the area of pasture is sufficient or deficient in nitrogen.
1. To indicate through leaf color of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés using RGB system, if this has sufficient or deficient nitrogen status, reling on the principle that N status of the plants can be describe by RGB wavelengths reflection, and that the leaf spectral signature can be accurately determined from field images acquired with a digital camera. 
 2. The description of input images: The file "Foto1.png", acquired by the student, is an example of an image obtained in the field, containing by the base in black background and leaves of Xaraés grass to be analyzed as to its composition in RGB. The RGB color can be converted to HSV color. The mean value RGB or HSV of leaf will be applied to vegetation indexes. Leaves texture will not be analyzed.
